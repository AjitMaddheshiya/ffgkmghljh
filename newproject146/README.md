### Production Recommendations
For production use, consider:
- **Backend Integration** - Add server-side validation
- **Database Storage** - Implement proper data persistence
- **API Security** - Add authentication tokens and API keys
- **HTTPS** - Ensure secure data transmission
- **Server Monitoring** - Implement server-side security logging
